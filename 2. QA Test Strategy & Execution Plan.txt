Assumptions:
Hotel details page is not yet implemented
No hotels/details appear in the Overview page
No details appear in the Account page

High-level Positive Scenarios to test:
App Launch/Terminate - Ensure the app loads/closes successfully
Hotel Search - Input search terms and verify hotel listings matching the search are displayed (high amounts of test data needed), clear search using X
Favorites - Add/Remove a Hotel to favorites and verify this is reflected in the Favorites/Hotels tab (variying test data - hotels with short/long names/descriptions)

High-level UI Test cases:
Verify all labels, buttons, and images are correctly rendered
Verify fonts, colors, and margins match the designss, and good practices like the WCAG are followed
Verify all interactive elements are clickable/tappable and accessible/leading to corresponding view
Verify no overlapping elements on the screen
Verify potrait and landscape modes correctly display each page
Verify the UI responsiveness on different screen sizes and devices
Verify there is a consistency of style across screens (e.g. button styles, headers)
Verify layout adjusts properly for tablet and devices with foldable screens
Verify loading states are indicated (e.g. endless spinners/placeholders)

High-level App State Transition cases:
Navigating to/from Overview -> Hotels -> Overview -> Favorites -> etc. and verifying that the states (e.g. previous search performed) are persisted
Back navigation from the different views (asserting persistance of state if required by design)
Reopening app after user puts it in background (app state persistence is retsored)

Edge and negative cases:
Search for hotels using long strings (test for buffer overflow, UI freezes, memory leaks)
SQL injection against the input fields (hotel search)
Add hunders of entries in the Favorites tab
Search using special symbols (!@#%, emojis, JSON, and e.g. cyrilic) and see if this impacts the search results and if such are found if present in results
Check the app generated data on the device and if it exposes some sensitive information (API keys, secrets)
Missing/Wrong API key
No search results
Network failures
Insufficient disk space
